This project builds a supervised deep learning model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques like HTML cleaning, tokenisation, stopword removal, and lemmatisation. Pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings convert text to numerical form, and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) processes the data. Dropout layers and padded sequences help improve performance. The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, achieving 69% accuracy despite computational limits.
